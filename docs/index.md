This documentation is for `Thoth.Fetch` v2, documentation for older versions can be found here:

- [Thoth.Fetch v1](/Thoth.Fetch/versions/v1.html)

## Usage

Thoth.Fetch provides an easy to use API for working with [Fable.Fetch](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable-fetch) and [Thoth.Json](https://mangelmaxime.github.io/Thoth/json/v3.html). It supports both manual and auto coders depending on your preferences.

For each method, it provides a **safe** and an **unsafe** version.

We call **safe** a method which returns a `Result<'T, FetchError>`.

We call **unsafe** a method that will throw an exception when a coder fails.

List of "unsafe" methods:
- fetchAs
- get
- post
- put
- patch
- delete

List of "safe" methods:
- tryFetchAs
- tryGet
- tryPost
- tryPut
- tryPatch
- tryDelete

### Successful request

A request is successful if no [error case](#Errored-request) has been encounter. There is one exception to this rule which is `unit` request.

In the case of `unit`, `Thoth.Fetch` will consider the request valid if it gets a result from the server. It means it doesn't validate the `body` content.

It is useful if you want to send a request to the server and want to `ignore` the result.

Example:

```fsharp
promise {
    // ...
    do! Fetch.post("https://my-servver.com/log", "Some data to log")
    // or
    do! Fetch.delete("https://my-servver.com/user/2")
    // or
    let! res = Fetch.delete("https://my-servver.com/user/2")
    // res value is ()
    // ...
}
```

### Errored request

`Thoth.Fetch` can return different errors:

1. If an exception occured by preparing the request, you will get `PreparingRequestFailed` with the `exception` as an argument.

1. If there was an error during the request execution, you will get `NetworkError` with the `exception` as an argument.

1. If we received a result but the `statusCode` was not ok (outside of the range 200-299), you will get `FetchFailed` with the raw `response` as an argument.

1. If we received a result but `Thoth.Json` decoding failed, you will get `DecodingFailed` with the error message as an argument.

## Manual coders

### Example

#### Define your decoder, encoder, and extracoder

```fsharp
open Thoth.Fetch
open Thoth.Json
open System

/// Type representing our ressource
type Book =
    { Id : int
      Title : string
      Author : string
      CreatedAt : DateTime
      UpdatedAt : DateTime option }

    /// Transform a Book from JSON
    static member Decoder =
        Decode.object (fun get ->
            { Id = get.Required.Field "id" Decode.int
              Title = get.Required.Field "title" Decode.string
              Author = get.Required.Field "author" Decode.string
              CreatedAt = get.Required.Field "createdAt" Decode.datetime
              UpdatedAt = get.Optional.Field "updatedAt" Decode.datetime }
        )

    /// Transform JSON as Book
    static member Encoder (book : Book)=
        Encode.object [
            "id", Encode.int book.Id
            "title", Encode.string book.Title
            "author", Encode.string book.Author
            "createdAt", Encode.datetime book.CreatedAt
            "updatedAt", Encode.option Encode.datetime book.UpdatedAt
        ]

let bookCoder: ExtraCoders = Extra.empty
                             |> Extra.withCustom Book.Encoder Book.Decoder
```

#### GET request

```fsharp
let getBookById (id : int) =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" id
        return! Fetch.get(url, decoder = Book.Decoder)
    }
```

#### POST request

```fsharp
let createBook (book : Book) =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            Encode.object [
                "title", Encode.string book.Title
                "author", Encode.string book.Author
                "createdAt", Encode.datetime book.CreatedAt
                "updatedAt", Encode.option Encode.datetime book.UpdatedAt
            ]
        return! Fetch.post(url, data, decoder = Book.Decoder)
    }
```

#### PUT request

```fsharp
let updateBook (book : Book) =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            Encode.object [
                "id", Encode.int book.Id
                "title", Encode.string book.Title
                "author", Encode.string book.Author
                "createdAt", Encode.datetime book.CreatedAt
                "updatedAt", Encode.option Encode.datetime book.UpdatedAt
            ]
        return! Fetch.put(url, data, decoder = Book.Decoder)
    }
```

#### DELETE request

```fsharp
let deleteBook (book : Book) : JS.Promise<bool> =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" book.Id
        return! Fetch.delete()
    }
```

## Auto coders

You need to help F# type inference determine which type is expected.

Here is two ways to do it, more exists but thuse are the simpler:

### Type via the promise result

```fsharp
let getBookById (id : int) : JS.Promise<Book> =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" id
        return! Fetch.get(url, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }

let createBook (book : Book) : JS.Promise<Book> =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            {| title = book.Title
               author = book.Author
               createdAt = book.CreatedAt
               updatedAt = book.UpdatedAt |}

        return! Fetch.post(url, data, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }
```

### Type when calling Fetch method
```fsharp
let getBookById (id : int) =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" id
        return! Fetch.get<_, Book>(url, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }

let createBook (book : Book) =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            {| title = book.Title
               author = book.Author
               createdAt = book.CreatedAt
               updatedAt = book.UpdatedAt |}

        return! Fetch.post<_, Book>(url, data, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }
```

### Example

#### Define your type

```fsharp
open Fable.Core
open Thoth.Fetch
open System

/// Type representing our ressource
type Book =
    { Id : int
      Title : string
      Author : string
      CreatedAt : DateTime
      UpdatedAt : DateTime option }
```

#### GET request

```fsharp
let getBookById (id : int) : JS.Promise<Book> =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" id
        return! Fetch.get(url, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }
```

#### POST request

```fsharp
let createBook (book : Book) : JS.Promise<Book> =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            {| title = book.Title
               author = book.Author
               createdAt = book.CreatedAt
               updatedAt = book.UpdatedAt |}

        return! Fetch.post(url, data, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }
```

#### PUT request

```fsharp
let updateBook (book : Book) : JS.Promise<Book> =
    promise {
        let url = "http://localhost:8080/books/"
        let data =
            {| id = book.Id
               title = book.Title
               author = book.Author
               createdAt = book.CreatedAt
               updatedAt = book.UpdatedAt |}

        return! Fetch.put(url, data, caseStrategy = CamelCase)
    }
```

#### DELETE request

```fsharp
let deleteBook (book : Book) : JS.Promise<unit> =
    promise {
        let url = sprintf "http://localhost:8080/books/%i" book.Id
        return! Fetch.delete(url)
    }
```

### Keep control over Thoth.Json

When using auto coders, you can pass `caseStrategy` and/or `extra` arguments in order to control `Thoth.Json` behaviour. You can learn more about them by reading `Thoth.Json` [documentation](https://mangelmaxime.github.io/Thoth/json/v3.html).

### Setting Request Headers
HttpRequestHeader types are defined under Fetch.Types.  If you are getting a 404 error using Saturn plug 'acceptJson',you may need to set the Accept header on the Request, as in
```Fetch.get(url, headers = [Fetch.Types.Accept "application/json"], decoder = myDecoder)```
